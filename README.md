# tidbyt

This is my repository for experimenting with Tidbyt development

## Setup

Install [Pixlet](https://tidbyt.dev/docs/build/installing-pixlet):

```zsh
brew install tidbyt/tidbyt/pixlet
```

Log in to Pixlet:

```
pixlet login
```

## Plans I have

- [ ] [**WQXR "What's On?"**](/wqxr/)
  - Show what is currently playing on WQXR on the Tidbyt
  - Possibly later: make a more generic "NYPR What's On?" app that lets you choose from any of the streams on New York Public Radio and show the "What's On" response on the Tidbyt (the API response includes all the different streams, it probably wouldn't be too hard)
