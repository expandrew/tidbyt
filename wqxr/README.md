# WQXR

Show what's currently playing on [WQXR](https://wqxr.org) on Tidbyt

## Development

Use VS Code Task **Pixlet: (WQXR): Serve** to get started, then open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in the browser to see the Pixlet output.

I have some mock API responses from WQXR in the [`wqxr-mock-api`](wqxr-mock-api) folder that can be used with Pixlet by running the **API: (WQXR): Serve mock API** VS Code task and uncommenting the appropriate `WHATS_ON` lines in the main [wqxr.star](/wqxr/wqxr.star) file.
