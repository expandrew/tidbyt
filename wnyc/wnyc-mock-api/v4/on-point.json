Interwoven are programs containing interviews with personalities, politicians, musicians, writers, and journalists. On Point deliberately seeks out distinct and provocative voices that may be new to public radio or that may not have been heard in quite the same context before. Debriefs, discussions and radio diaries are designed not just to stimulate the intellect of the listeners but also to elicit emotion and passion about the state of national and international affairs.</p>",
